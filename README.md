 A robotic arm with a human touch.

`african.grey` is a project to design a robotic arm with a human-friendly
interface. Grey (she/fae) is a chatbot that connects to a robotic arm and can
identify objects, describe what she sees, and point to specific objects. She
can also make small talk about these objects.
